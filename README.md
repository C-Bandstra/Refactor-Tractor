# Refactor Tractor

Refactor Tractor is a group project for Front End Module 2 students at the Turing School of Software and Design. Group members were given a premade codebase with which they were required to fetch data from an API endpoint to use as the users unique data sets for 4 activities (steps, hydration, stairs, and sleep).  The main goals of this project were to implement Sass styling in the form of mixins and variables, fetching data from an API, be able update that data through a POST request, ensure each member of the team can speak with clarity about the codebase, make sure the application maintains functionality while using different browsers and screen sizes, establish accessible aspects for users with visual, functional, and auditory disabilities, refactor redundancies and ensure methods are dynamic, and safeguard the codebase from bugs by implementing tests.
